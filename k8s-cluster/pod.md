# Kubernetes Pod

* A group of one or more containers
* Serves as a unit of deployment, horizontal scaling, and replication
* Modelled as a group of Docker containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes
* A loose equivalent of processes running on the same physical or virtual machine
* Containers within a Pod share an IP address and port space
* Pods are considered to be relatively ephemeral entities: scheduled, replaced, terminated, and deleted

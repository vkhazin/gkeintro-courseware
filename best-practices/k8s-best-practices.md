# Kubernetes Best Practices

* Organize deployments into virtual clusters using namespaces
* Use readiness probes to let Kubernetes know when your app is ready to serve traffic
* Leverage liveness probes to let Kubernetes detect whether an app is alive or dead
* Keep control of deployment with requests and limits
* Configure deployments with env vars, config maps, and secrets
* Leverage Role-Based Access Control to restrict access to cluster administration
